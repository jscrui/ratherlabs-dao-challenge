# Frontend Readme: DApp Boilerplate

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, you'll need to clone the project and install its dependencies.
```
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the development server using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open a browser window to the app running on `http://localhost:3000`. The development server automatically reloads the app whenever you make changes to the source code.

You can also build a production-ready version of the app using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and bundle all the necessary files into a `dist` folder.

To preview the production build, you can use the following command:

```
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server that serves the production build of the app.
